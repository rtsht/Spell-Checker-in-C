# Spell-Checker-in-C

## Description

This project contains a Makefile and is intended to be compiled according to the directions listed in the Makefile. After compiling, the program is meant to be run by the command:

./wuzzle scorefile wordfile

where scorefile is a valid list of english letters and their corresponding counts and scores in the format ‘A,1,7’ for each line, and wordfile is a valid list of words in the format ‘WORD’ for each line. This repo contains examples of these two files as ['word_scores'](/word_scores) and ['words23_1000'](/words23_1000).

The program was written in a Debian environment, compiled with gcc and also tested on Rhel.
